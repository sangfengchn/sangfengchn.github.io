<h3>Title</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hemisphere- and gender-related differences in small-world brain networks: A resting-state functional MRI study</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level3">
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Male have a large normalized clustering coefficient in the right hemispheric network, but a lower clustering coefficient in the left hemispheric network.</p>
<p>Significant hemisphere-related differences in the regional nodal characteristics: frontal and occipital regions (leftward asymmetry), temporal regions (rightward asymmetry).</p>
</div>
<div id="conclustions" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclustions</h3>
<p>Topological organization of human brain functional networks is associated with gender and hemispheres.</p>
</div>
<div id="notes" class="section level3">
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Alterations of brain asymmetries are associated with behavior changes in normal aging and in various neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, stroke and dyslexia.</p>
<p>Statistically, males perform better in right-lateralized visuospatial perception processing, whereas females have advantages in left-lateralized language processing.</p>
<p>Small-world properties is used to identify the range of sparsity (10%~46%). (<span class="math inline">\(\gamma&gt;1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\approx1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma&gt;1.2\)</span>)</p>
<p>Generate the comprehensive score by multiplying the sparsity interval and measures at all sparsities.</p>
<p>Hub node is at least one standard deviation greater than the average of parameter (x &gt; mean + SD).</p>
<p>Asymmetry score (A) = 100 * (R-L)/(0.5*(R+L)), and positive asymmetry scores indicated right-ward asymmetry and vice versa.</p>
