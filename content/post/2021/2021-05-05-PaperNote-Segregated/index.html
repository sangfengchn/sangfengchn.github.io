<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>RSFC <strong>within and between brain system</strong> exhibits progressive difference across adulthood, even in the absence of disease.</p>
<p>Increasing age is associated with decreasing connectivity within systems and increasing connectivity between brain systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>increasing age is accompanied by decreasing segregation</li>
<li>different types of functional systems exhibit different trajectories of age-related differences in system segregation</li>
</ul>
<p>With healthy adult , increasing segregation is associated with superior cognitive ability independently of influence of age.</p>
<p>Higher RSFC segregation exhibit the greatest improvements, and positivity correlate with improvement in the therapy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(Segregation=(within-between)/within\)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Modularity</strong> is calculated as the fraction of edges that fall within the given communities of a network compared to the expected fraction if the connections were distributed at random across the network.</p>

<h3>Future</h3>
<p>System segregation of an <strong>individual change over time</strong> and relation to their health</p>
<p>How do properties of the <strong>anatomical network</strong> of brain relate to the maintenance and modulation in segregation and integration of the brain network’s functional systems?</p>
<p>Mechanisms of <strong>dynamically</strong> adjust the segregation and integration</p>
<p><strong>Optimal network regime or configuration</strong>, in aging and disease the differences in segregation</p>
<p><strong>Individual differences</strong></p>
